# ArduinoProjects
A repository where I'll store some experiments I do with an Arduino I've acquired

####01 - Led blink
The 'hello world' of Arduino projects.
A blinking LED light, that turns on for 2 seconds, blinks a bit, then repeats.

####02 - Button Push
For those who want to control a led with a one-way button, without using resistors.
An on/off button that toggles an LED light.

####03 - LCD Dispaly control
Displaying text with some timing in an LCD display, and an on/off switch.
